## Peace Of Mind
Peace Of Mind is a pet sitting management application. Its goal is to provide a simple and easy way to keep track of basic day to day business activities like
adding clients and keeping track of jobs.
## Use
Peace Of Mind currently has 5 data tables, representing clients, pets, services, jobs, and a junction table for pets and jobs. Users should first create an account
to access functions for these tables. As a future goal, Peace Of Mind will be able to import client information from external sources. For now though, once you have
created an account you must input clients manually. Also enter information about pets and the services that you offer. Once that is all complete, you can begin creating jobs,
which is the focus of this app. Jobs work by pulling together clients, pets, and services into one time interval. Future goals for jobs are to implement an event 
calendar, and allow the user to specify recurring jobs. As it is now, you can see a list of your daily schedule by clicking "Today's Schedule".
## UI
The idea behind the UI is that the user can navigate to main data categories using the top nav bar, and then control the views of those categories using the sidebar.
